spr.x += 200;

This is used to move all of the menu assets (story mode, freeplay, etc.) to desired X axis. Usually I use 200, but if you use -0 or 0, then it'll be to the far left, like, FAR left.
-200 is to the left, and 200 is to the right. 

Where do you put it? Lazy to explain, but there SHOULD be a gamebanana tutorial that can assist you in locating and putting it in.
